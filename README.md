# Hi! I'm Matthew Alvarez 👋

**`Back-End Developer`**

I am a student at KEAN University studying in Computer Science and Engineering
with a focus on Mathematics. Most of my projects are associated with my classes with a few being
long-term projects outside of academics. Currently, I am working on broadening my skillset and 
exposure to other languages and business-standard practices to aid in my career.

	<summary><h3> Goals and Motivation 💎</h3></summary>
   My long-term goal is to make a product that impacts the Software Development field and those associated with it. This stems from my upbringing where I lived in 
  an environment that favored medical and legal interests. At a young age, I was always drawn to computers and technology and found myself tinkering with system access
  restrictions or operating system files. This led to the decision that I must satisfy those who favored a more secure occupation whilst also doing what I'm passionate
  about. A shorter-term goal would be making a network of peers that support one another through varying perspectives, skillsets, and practices. I've only recently realized
  that a strong circle of family, friends, coworkers, and mentors is important in one's own growth, therefore, I try to make this a goal wherever I am in life.
