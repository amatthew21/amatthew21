# Hi! I'm Matthew Alvarez 👋

**`Aspiring Developer`**

I am a student at KEAN University studying Computational Science and Engineering. My projects involve Database Structures and a 
few involve Web/Game Development as passion projects. Currently, I am working on broadening my skillset and exposure to other languages and business-standard 
practices to aid in my career.

	<summary><h3> Goals and Motivation 💎</h3></summary>
      My long-term goal is to create an impactful product that can benefit not only the Computer Science field but also those outside it. I'm always looking for
   ways to connect my interests with others, and that goes for programming as well. Since my introduction to computers, I've always been curious about how things
   work. Games, videos, spreadsheets, operating systems, all of these were things I looked forward to using in the future. My path toward being a programmer
   was kickstarted when I learned how to code in HTML and CSS in my second year of middle school. What started out as a class requirement, turned into a hobby
   almost immediately. Since then, I've been insistent on the saying "There's a computer program for this". Fast forward to today, I'm still convinced that I 
   can streamline most daily activities using my skills as a programmer. From keeping notes to generating a workout routine, all of these things can be connected
   to my one true passion, Computers.
